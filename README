EmailDownloader is a simple tool that helps you download all the emails (text as well as attachments) on your computer.

You need to run the maildownloader.py file in Python2

You will be prompted to enter your email address and password along with a date range

All the emails in the specified date range from your account will be downloaded to your PC

The script was successfully tested on a gmail account. I have tried to add support for some of the other hosts:
rediffmail
yahoomail
aol
lycos
mail

However they may not run successfully.
